<h1>MSYS2</h1>
<h2>Software Distribution and Building Platform for Windows</h2>
</header>

**MSYS2** is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an
easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native Windows
software.

It consists of a command line terminal called
[mintty](https://mintty.github.io/), bash, version control systems like git and
subversion, tools like tar and awk and even build systems like autotools, all
based on a modified version of [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com). Despite some of
these central parts being based on Cygwin, the main focus of MSYS2 is to provide
a build environment for native Windows software and the Cygwin-using parts are
kept at a minimum. MSYS2 provides up-to-date native builds for GCC, mingw-w64,
CPython, CMake, Meson, OpenSSL, FFmpeg, Rust, Ruby, just to name a few.

To provide easy installation of packages and a way to keep them updated it
features a package management system called
[Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman), which should be familiar
to Arch Linux users. It brings many powerful features such as dependency
resolution and simple complete system upgrades, as well as straight-forward and
reproducible package building. Our package repository contains [more than 2000
pre-built packages](https://packages.msys2.org/base) ready to install.

For more details see ['What is MSYS2?'](docs/what-is-msys2.md) which also
compares MSYS2 to other software distributions and development environments like
[Cygwin](https://cygwin.com),
[WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux),
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), ... and ['Who
Is Using MSYS2?'](docs/who-is-using-msys2.md) to see which projects are using
MSYS2 and what for.


## Installation

1. Download the installer: <a href="https://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/msys2-x86_64-20210105.exe" class="button">msys2-x86_64-20210105.exe</a>

    <span style="opacity: 0.6;">Verify with SHA256 checksum `c6cbaad7f3e939ec9024ed6a6a36b027bff2cc2785d36985ce2f8efe1fa81883`
    or [GPG signature](https://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/msys2-x86_64-20210105.exe.sig)
    by [0xf7a49b0ec](http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x0ebf782c5d53f7e5fb02a66746bd761f7a49b0ec&fingerprint=on&op=vindex).</span>

2. Run the installer. MSYS2 requires 64 bit Windows 7 or newer.

3. Enter your desired **Installation Folder** (short ASCII-only path, no accents, no spaces, no symlinks, no subst or network drives).

4. When done, tick **Run MSYS2 now**.

5. Update the package database and base packages.  Unless your setup file is very recent, it will take two steps.  First run `pacman -Syu`:

    ```
    $ pacman -Syu
    :: Synchronizing package databases...
     mingw32                        805.0 KiB

    This problem is probably due to using incompatible versions of the cygwin DLL.
    Search for cygwin1.dll using the Windows Start->Find/Search facility
    and delete all but the most recent version.  The most recent version *should*
    reside in x:\cygwin\bin, where 'x' is the drive on which you have
    installed the cygwin distribution.  Rebooting is also suggested if you
    are unable to find another cygwin DLL.
          0 [main] pacman 427 dofork: child -1 - forked process 42236 died unexpectedly, retry 0, exit code 0xC0000142, errno 11
    error: could not fork a new process (Resource temporarily unavailable)
    :: To complete this update all MSYS2 processes including this terminal will be closed. Confirm to proceed [Y/n] Y
    ```

    The last error is expected and won't be an issue.

6. Run "MSYS2 MSYS" from Start menu.  Update the rest of the base packages with `pacman -Su`:

    ```
    $ pacman -Su
    :: Starting core system upgrade...
     there is nothing to do
    :: Starting full system upgrade...
    resolving dependencies...
    looking for conflicting packages...

    Net Upgrade Size:       3.01 MiB
    
    :: Proceed with installation? [Y/n] Y
    [... downloading and installation continues ...]
    ```

7. Now MSYS2 is ready for you.  You probably will want to install some tools and the mingw-w64 GCC to start compiling:

    ````
    $ pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
    warning: file-5.39-2 is up to date -- skipping
    [... more warnings ...]
    :: There are 48 members in group base-devel:

8. To start building using the mingw-w64 GCC, close this window and run "MSYS MinGW 64-bit" from Start menu.  Now you can call `make` or `gcc` to build software for Windows.

9. Check out [the introduction page](wiki/MSYS2-introduction/) to learn which
   Start menu item to use when and which packages to install.  Take look at
   [Detailed MSYS2 install guide](wiki/MSYS2-installation/) for troubleshooting
   and additional details on how to keep your MSYS2 up-to-date.
